## Tik-Tac-Toe 3x3 Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for developing a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game. The main objective of this project is to implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game on an ESP-8266 microcontroller, allowing users to play the game on a microcontroller-based platform. 

## Task Details
This project involves multiple stages:
- Design and implement the logic of a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Use ESP-8266 hardware for running the game.
- Implement input/output handling using available hardware components.
- Ensure that the game runs smoothly and handles basic user interaction.
- Prepare for further development and integration with additional hardware in future tasks.
